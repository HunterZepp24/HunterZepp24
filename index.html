  <p>I’ve always had a creative mind, ever since I was a little kid, and when I discovered design in high school, I was
    hooked immediately and have been ever since. I love the idea of creating something that serves a purpose, and design
    gives me the opportunity to do so. I’m someone who also has a wide range of interests. I love cars, video
    games, and pretty much all things 80s. I also love nerdy things like Star Wars, Harry Potter, Comics, and Dungeons &
    Dragons.</p>
